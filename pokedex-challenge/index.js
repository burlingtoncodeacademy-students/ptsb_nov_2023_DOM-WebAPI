?   Challenge:
        - Grab a hold of the HTML elements that are necessary
        - Use the https://pokeapi.co/ to retrieve the information of a pokemon
        - Then using the input field, a user should be able to type in the pokemon name or number.

        *HINT There is a method you can use to grab a hold of the value contained within the input field

        - The button with the text of "Look", should execute a fetch to the Pokemon API
        The API should return the exact data for the pokemon-name/# that was provided to the input field

        * You will only need to fetch to one endpoint

        Display the results within each respected html element

        * Be sure to understand the data type you are working with to display the results correctly

        - Name
        - Image
        - Stats
        - Moves

        Bonus* 
        - When a user goes and types in another pokemon-name/#, the moves and stats keep stacking on top of the previous data.
        
        Handle clearing out the past data to present the new data.
